20. Automation Scope

Automation testing will focus on stabilizing regression, improving test coverage, and reducing manual effort for repetitive validation across browsers and environments.
The goal is to automate the end-to-end ticket booking flow, including all key positive and regression scenarios, while keeping complex third-party interactions (like payment gateways) simulated through mocks.

20.1 Automation Objectives

Ensure consistent and reliable execution of core booking flows.

Reduce manual testing time for frequent releases.

Improve early defect detection through CI integration.

Maintain a reusable and scalable test framework.

20.2 Automation Tool & Framework
Area	Tools/Frameworks
Automation Tool	Selenium WebDriver / Cypress
Framework	TestNG (Java) or Mocha (JavaScript)
Build Tool	Maven / npm
Reporting	Extent Reports / Allure
Execution Platform	BrowserStack / Jenkins CI
Version Control	GitHub / GitLab
Locator Strategy	XPath, CSS Selectors, Page Object Model (POM)
20.3 Scope of Automation
Area	Modules to Automate	Priority	Notes
Smoke Tests	Launch site, select city, view movies	High	Run daily build verification
Functional Flow	End-to-end booking: Select city → Movie → Theatre → Seats → Mock Payment → Confirmation	High	Primary regression scenario
Seat Selection Module	Seat layout validation, seat count, total price	High	Data-driven (different seat types)
Payment Mock Tests	Valid/invalid payments using dummy data	Medium	Use payment gateway stubs
UI Regression	Critical UI elements validation	Medium	Visual comparison using screenshot baselines
Search Module	Movie search autocomplete	Low	Automate only stable UI components
Cross-browser Validation	Execute core booking flow on Chrome, Edge, Firefox	Medium	Parallel execution via BrowserStack
Error Handling	Invalid promo, session timeout, unavailable seat	Medium	Negative case validation
My Bookings Page	Verify confirmed booking display	Medium	Post-booking verification
20.4 Automation Exclusions
Excluded Area	Reason
Third-party payment gateway live testing	Unstable external dependency
SMS/Email verification	Tested via API stubs or manual validation
Ad banners and popups	Non-critical for booking flow
Captcha validation (if any)	Requires bypass configuration
20.5 Test Case to Automation Mapping
Manual TC ID	Description	Automation Feasibility	Remarks
TC_01 – TC_04	Location & Movie selection	✅ Yes	Stable UI – high ROI
TC_05 – TC_11	Theatre & Seat selection	✅ Yes	Core flow – must automate
TC_12 – TC_16	Payment Page	⚙️ Partial	Use mocked payment APIs
TC_17 – TC_20	Booking Confirmation	✅ Yes	Verify confirmation message & booking ID
TC_21 – TC_25	Negative scenarios	⚙️ Partial	Automate deterministic ones only
TC_26 – TC_29	UI/UX & Cross-browser	⚙️ Partial	Limited to layout validation
TC_30 – TC_32	Performance	❌ No	To be covered by Load Testing tools
20.6 Automation Architecture

Proposed framework design (Selenium + TestNG):

src/
 ├── main/
 │   ├── java/
 │   │   ├── pages/           → Page Objects (HomePage, MoviePage, SeatPage, PaymentPage)
 │   │   ├── utils/           → Driver setup, Config, Reporting, Waits
 │   └── resources/
 │       ├── config.properties → URLs, credentials
 ├── test/
 │   ├── java/
 │   │   ├── tests/           → Test classes mapped to manual TC IDs
 │   │   ├── data/            → DataProviders (city, movie, seat type)
 │   └── reports/
 │       ├── extent-report.html


Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)

Data-Driven Testing: Use TestNG DataProviders or JSON for inputs

Execution: Parallel test runs across browsers via TestNG XML

Reports: Extent Reports or Allure for detailed HTML summaries

20.7 CI/CD Integration

Automation suite integrated with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Trigger automated tests on every build deployment.

Test results auto-published to dashboard/reporting tool.

20.8 Automation Deliverables

Automation Test Strategy Document

Test Framework Repository (POM-based)

CI Pipeline Configuration

Execution Reports & Logs

Traceability Matrix (Manual–Automated linkage)

20.9 Maintenance Plan

Review and update scripts for every UI change.

Revalidate locators post each release.

Maintain a regression suite that runs on-demand or nightly.

20.10 Automation KPIs
Metric	Target
Automation Coverage	≥ 70% of regression test cases
Execution Time	≤ 20 minutes (parallel)
Build Integration	100% on release builds
Script Maintenance	<10% effort per sprint
